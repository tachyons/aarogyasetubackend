        <p class="infoText">
          These terms of service (<strong>Terms</strong>) govern your use of the Aarogya Setu
          application for mobile and handheld devices (<strong>App</strong>) and the services
          provided thereunder. Please read these terms and conditions (<strong>Terms</strong>)
          carefully before you download, install or use the App. By clicking on the “I Agree”
          button, you signify your acceptance of the Terms, and your agreement to be bound by them.
          The Terms may be amended from time to time with notice to you. In order to continue using
          the App, you will be required to accept the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <div class="infoPointWrap">
          <p class="infoPointHead">1. SERVICE OVERVIEW</p>
          <p class="infoText">
            The App is part of a service designed to (i) enable registered users who have come in
            contact with other registered users who have tested positive for the severe acute
            respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (<strong>COVID-19</strong>) to be notified, traced
            and suitably supported, (ii) to function as an indication of whether or not a user has
            been infected or is likely to have been infected. (iii) provide users useful information
            in relation to COVID-19, (iv) to allow users to access convenience services in relation
            to COVID-19, (v) to allow users to disclose their health status by displaying a QR code 
			or by accepting a request to share their health status through specially designed APIs and
			(vi) to display a government issued ePass (<strong>Services</strong>).
            When the App is installed on your mobile or handheld device, it detects when your device
            comes within Bluetooth range of any other registered user’s device and initiates a
            protocol by which the information specified in the Privacy Policy (including location
            information) about that other registered user is collected. In the event you test
            positive for COVID-19, the Government of India will contact and/or inform such
            registered users you have come in contact with over the past 30 days who have a risk of
            being infected, to administer the appropriate medical intervention. Similarly, you will
            be notified if, as a result of having come in contact with any persons who have tested
            positive for COVID-19, that you have a risk of being infected. The App also allows users
            to conduct a self-assessment test to assess whether their symptoms combined with other
            relevant factors affects their risk of being infected. The App will also serve as
            digital representation of an e-Pass where available. The App will also provide links to
            convenience services offered by various service providers. Accessing the links will take
            users to external sites from where these convenience services will be provided.
