          When you use Aarogya Setu (<strong>App</strong>), some personal information is collected
          from and about you. We are committed to protecting the security of this information and
          safeguarding your privacy. This privacy policy sets out the details of the personal
          information collected, the manner in which it collected, by whom as well as the purposes
          for which it is used. At registration you accepted the terms of this Privacy Policy and
          your use of the App signifies your continued acceptance thereof. This Privacy Policy may
          be revised from time to time and you will be notified of all such changes. In order to use
          the App, you will be required to consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy as revised
          from time to time.

            1. INFORMATION COLLECTED AND MANNER OF COLLECTION
          </p>
          <ol class="infoOrderList">
            <li>
              When you register on the App, the following information is collected from you and
              stored securely on a server operated and managed by the Government of India
              (<strong>Server</strong>) – (i) name; (ii) phone number; (iii) age; (iv) sex; (v)
              profession; and (vi) countries visited in the last 30 days. This information will be
              stored on the Server and a unique digital id (<strong>DiD</strong>) will be pushed to
              your App. The DiD will thereafter be used to identify you in all subsequent App
              related transactions and will be associated with any data or information uploaded from
              the App to the Server. At registration, your location details are also captured and
              uploaded to the Server.
            </li>
            <li>
              When two registered users come within Bluetooth range of each other, their Apps will
              automatically exchange DiDs and record the time and GPS location at which the contact
              took place. The information that is collected from your App will be securely stored on
              the mobile device of the other registered user and will not be accessible by such
              other user. In the event such other registered user tests positive for COVID-19, this
              information will be securely uploaded from his/her mobile device and stored on the
              Server.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each time you complete a self-assessment test the App will collect your location data
              and upload it along with the results of your self-assessment and your DiD to the
              Server.
            </li>
            <li>
              The App continuously collects your location data and stores securely on your mobile
              device, a record of all the places you have been at 15 minute intervals. This
              information will only be uploaded to the Server along with your DiD, (i) if you test
              positive for COVID-19; and/or (ii) if your self-declared symptoms indicate that you
              are likely to be infected with COVID-19; and/or (iii) if the result of your
              self-assessment test is either YELLOW or ORANGE. For the avoidance of doubt, this
              information will NOT be uploaded to the Server if you are not unwell of if the result
              of your self-assessment test is GREEN.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have tested positive for COVID-19 or if there is a high likelihood of you being
              infected, you have the option to press the Report button on the App which will allow
              you to either request a test or report that you have tested positive for COVID-19.
              When you press the Report button the data collected under Clauses 1(b) and (d) and
              securely stored on your device will be uploaded to the Server with your consent.

          <ol class="infoOrderList">
            <li>
              The personal information collected from you at the time of registration under Clause
              1(a) above, will be stored on the Server and only be used by the Government of India
              in anonymized, aggregated datasets for the purpose of generating reports, heat maps
              and other statistical visualisations for the purpose of the management of COVID-19 in
              the country or to provide you general notifications pertaining to COVID-19 as may be
              required. Your DiD will only be co-related with your personal information in order to
              communicate to you the probability that you have been infected with COVID-19 and/or to
              provide persons carrying out medical and administrative interventions necessary in
              relation to COVID-19, the information they might need about you in order to carry out
              such interventions.
            </li>
            <li>
              The information collected from any other user’s mobile device and uploaded and stored
              on the Server in accordance with Clause 1(b) will be used to calculate your
              probability of having been infected with COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>
              The information collected under Clause 1(c) will be used by the Government of India to
              evaluate, based on the self-assessment tests and the GPS locations from where they are
              being uploaded, whether a disease cluster is developing at any geographic location.
            </li>
            <li>
              The information collected under Clause 1(d) and securely uploaded and stored on the
              Server will, in the event you have tested positive for COVID-19, be used to map the
              places you visited over the past 30 days in order to identify the locations that need
              to be sanitised and where people need to be more deeply tested and identify emerging
              areas where infection outbreaks are likely to occur. Where, in order to more
              accurately map the places you visited and/or the persons who need to be deeply tested,
              your personal information is required, the DiD associated with the information
              collected under Clause 1(d) will be co-related with your personal information
              collected under Clause 1(a).

              The information securely uploaded and stored on the Server under Clause 1(e) will be

              infected with COVID-19.
            </li>
            <li>
              The information collected under Clause 1 will not be used for any purpose other than
